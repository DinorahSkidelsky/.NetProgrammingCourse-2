## Second Practical Work for the .Net Programming Course

1. Create a program that calculates the VAT (IVA) of a product. The value of this product will be passed through the keyboard and it will show us on the screen the VAT value and its final value. VAT is 21%. For example, if we enter 100 as the product value, the VAT is 21 and the final value is 121.

2. Create a program to display numbers between 0 and 100 that are not divisible by 2. Use a While Loop.

3. Create the function for exercise 1 called CalcularIVA, which must receive a numeric type parameter and return the Final value with VAT.
